all comands to write in terminal to execute
clear: it will clear all previous commands given by users       clear
cd: change or get into the directory                            cd filename
cd..  : coming out to the directory                             cd..
mkdir  : make new directory
ls: to get all files                                             ls
ls -a:   to get hidden files reference                            ls -a

clone and status              
clone-     remote(github), global(vs code or laptop os pc)          copy files from github to vscode or laptop       
 by copying HTTP address to  vscode terminal                          git clone copyaddress

status-  to check the status of changes at both places                 git status
If vscode content is changed then we have to "add and commit"
Types of Status:-
1. untracked- new file that is yet untracked    'new file'
2. modified-  changed  
3. staged- ready to commit                 ' add ' between case
4. unmodified- unchanged                   commit

add and commit
add: to add anything    git add filename or git add .     (. means to add everything )
commit: to commit       git commit -m "comment"

push- now pushing changes from local (vscode) to remote (github)
              ' git push origin main '

git init: used to create new git repo
git remote add origin link   :    to make a folder your origin or repo where yo have to add somthing
git remote -v   : to check status of origin repo or to verify remote
git branch :-    
Main branch or other branch      -- if want to make other branch as main branch (each branch will work differently with code and then merge the copy to main branch
git branch -M main:                to rename the branch as main here main is user defined
                             ' git push origin main '

Road Map of local git     gitHub repo < clone < changes < add < commit < Push
git checkout <- branch name ->     to navigate from one branch to another
git checkout -b <- new branch ->   to create new branch
git branch -d <- ranch nme ->       to delete branch
  git push origin feature : to push the changes 

To merge other branch to main barnch
Way 1:  git diff branch name               (to compare commits, branches, files and more)
        git merge branch name              ( to merge to branhes)

way 2 : by github  --> Pull Request 
  Pull and merge from githuub

now chenges transfer from github to vs code
Pull Command - used to ftech and download content from a remote(git) and immediately update to local(vscode) to compare
             git pull origin main
